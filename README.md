# 1. Explain the differences between Facebook Ads, Google Ads, RDS (Relational Database Service), and CleverTap in terms of data structure, API access, and data types.

1. Data Structure:
- Facebook Ads: The data structure for Facebook Ads includes information about ad campaigns, ad sets, ads, targeting criteria, and performance metrics such as clicks and impressions.
- Google Ads: The data structure for Google Ads includes information about ad campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, targeting criteria and performance metrics.
- RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed relational database service provided by AWS. It supports various database engines like MySQL or PostgreSQL with structured table-based data storage.
- CleverTap: CleverTap is a customer engagement platform that focuses on user profiles and event tracking to provide personalized messaging. It stores user attributes such as name,
email address etc., along with event history.

2. API Access:
- Facebook Ads: Facebook provides a Marketing API that allows developers to create and manage ad campaigns programmatically.
- Google Ads: Google provides the AdWords API which allows developers to manage their Google AdWords accounts through custom applications.
- RDS (Relational Database Service): AWS provides an API for managing RDS instances including creating databases,
managing backups etc.
CleverTap does have an extensive RESTful API which allows access to all of the platform's functionality including user profiles.

3. Data Types:
Facebook Ads and Google Aads APIs deal with advertising campaign metadata such as budget amounts,
targeting parameters etc., along with performance
metrics like impressions,cost per click etc.

RDS deals with structured relational tabular data types such as integers,characters,floats,date/time values etc.CleverTaps focus is more on customer/user profile
attributes(user demographic attributes)and event logs or behavioral/event based data.


# 2. Design a high-level ETL pipeline architecture for extracting data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads, transforming it, and loading it into an RDS database. Consider data extraction frequency, data transformations, error handling, and scalability.

1. Data Extraction
Data Sources:
Facebook Ads
Google Ads
Frequency:
Daily extraction to ensure up-to-date data while balancing load and resource usage.
Tools:
APIs: Use Facebook Graph API and Google Ads API for data extraction.
Scheduler: Use a scheduler like Apache Airflow or AWS Lambda to run extraction jobs daily.
2. Data Transformation
Transformation Steps:
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize formats (e.g., date formats, currency).
Data Mapping: Standardize the schema for both ad platforms to a common schema.
Aggregations: Calculate metrics like total spend, click-through rates, and impressions.
Enrichment: Add additional information such as campaign metadata or business-specific KPIs.
Tools:
Transformation Engine: Use a tool like Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.
Scripts: Use Python or SQL for data manipulation and transformation.
3. Data Loading
Destination:
Amazon RDS: A managed relational database service for scalability and reliability.
Tools:
Database Loader: Use tools like SQLAlchemy or AWS Data Pipeline for loading data into RDS.
4. Error Handling
Strategies:
Logging: Implement detailed logging at each stage of the pipeline (extraction, transformation, loading) using tools like AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack.
Retries: Set up automatic retries for transient errors, particularly during data extraction.
Alerts: Configure alerts for critical failures using services like Amazon SNS or PagerDuty.
5. Scalability
Approaches:
Distributed Processing: Use distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark for handling large volumes of data.
Auto-scaling: Utilize auto-scaling features of AWS services to adjust resources based on load.
Modular Architecture: Design the pipeline to be modular, allowing components to be independently scaled or updated.

This architecture ensures robust, scalable, and maintainable ETL processes for integrating Facebook Ads and Google Ads data into an RDS database.

#  3. What is Apache Airflow, and how does it facilitate ETL pipeline orchestration? Provide an example of an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for scheduling and orchestrating the ETL process described in Section 2.

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It's designed to automate complex data processing pipelines by managing the orchestration of tasks and ensuring that they are executed in the correct order, with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

Key Features:
DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): Define workflows as DAGs where nodes represent tasks and edges define dependencies between tasks.
Scheduling: Schedule workflows to run at specified intervals.
Monitoring: Provide tools to monitor, log, and troubleshoot workflows.
Extensibility: Integrate with various services and platforms using plugins and operators.

# 4. Explain the role of Kubernetes in deploying and managing ETL pipelines. How can Kubernetes ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and resource optimization for ETL tasks?

Role of Kubernetes in ETL Pipelines
Kubernetes is like a super smart manager for running applications, especially useful for managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. Here's how it helps:

Scalability: Imagine you run a shop and sometimes have a rush of customers. Kubernetes can automatically bring in more staff (ETL tasks) during rush hours and send them home when it's quiet. This way, you only use as many resources as needed.

Fault Tolerance: If an ETL task (like a shop worker) crashes or fails, Kubernetes can restart it or replace it with a new one without you having to intervene. It ensures your shop (pipeline) keeps running smoothly even when things go wrong.

Resource Optimization: Kubernetes ensures that your tasks don't hog all the resources. It sets limits so each task gets what it needs without overwhelming the system, just like making sure no single worker takes all the shop supplies.

Key Components for ETL Pipelines
Pods: These are like small containers (each running a piece of your ETL task). Each pod can be compared to a worker in your shop.
Deployments: These ensure you always have the right number of workers and that they are the right version.
Jobs and CronJobs: Jobs are for one-time tasks, like a special promotion in your shop. CronJobs are for regular tasks, like opening the shop every day at the same time.
ConfigMaps and Secrets: These are like instruction manuals and keys for your workers, ensuring they know what to do and have the passwords they need securely.
Persistent Volumes: Think of these as storage rooms where workers can keep data they need to use or generate during their tasks.

# 5. Given a JSON data sample from Facebook Ads containing ad performance metrics, write a Python function to transform this data into a structured format suitable for storage in an AWS Redshift database.

Transforming JSON Data for Redshift
Given the sample JSON data:

json

[
    {
        "ad_id": "123",
        "ad_name": "Ad 1",
        "clicks": 150,
        "impressions": 1000,
        "spend": 20.5,
        "date": "2024-07-01"
    },
    {
        "ad_id": "124",
        "ad_name": "Ad 2",
        "clicks": 200,
        "impressions": 1500,
        "spend": 30.75,
        "date": "2024-07-01"
    }
]
Here's the Python function to transform it:

python

import json
import pandas as pd

def transform_facebook_ads_data(json_data):
    ads_data = json.loads(json_data)
    df = pd.DataFrame(ads_data)
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
    transformed_data = [tuple(x) for x in df.to_records(index=False)]
    return transformed_data

--#Sample JSON data
json_data = '''[{"ad_id":"123","ad_name":"Ad 1","clicks":150,"impressions":1000,"spend":20.5,"date":"2024-07-01"},{"ad_id":"124","ad_name":"Ad 2","clicks":200,"impressions":1500,"spend":30.75,"date":"2024-07-01"}]'''

--#Transform the data
transformed_data = transform_facebook_ads_data(json_data)
print(transformed_data)
Loading into Redshift
Use psycopg2 to load the transformed data:

python

import psycopg2

def load_to_redshift(transformed_data, redshift_connection_details):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(**redshift_connection_details)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    insert_query = "INSERT INTO facebook_ads (ad_id, ad_name, clicks, impressions, spend, date) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"
    cursor.executemany(insert_query, transformed_data)
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

--#Redshift connection details
redshift_connection_details = {
    'dbname': 'your_dbname',
    'user': 'your_user',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'your_redshift_host'
}

-- #Load data to Redshift
load_to_redshift(transformed_data, redshift_connection_details)
