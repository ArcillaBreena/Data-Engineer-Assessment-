# Data-Engineer-Assessment-

#1. Explain the differences between Facebook Ads, Google Ads, RDS (Relational Database
Service), and CleverTap in terms of data structure, API access, and data types.

1. Data Structure:
- Facebook Ads: The data structure for Facebook Ads includes information about ad campaigns, ad sets, ads, targeting criteria, and performance metrics such as clicks and impressions.
- Google Ads: The data structure for Google Ads includes information about ad campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, targeting criteria and performance metrics.
- RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed relational database service provided by AWS. It supports various database engines like MySQL or PostgreSQL with structured table-based data storage.
- CleverTap: CleverTap is a customer engagement platform that focuses on user profiles and event tracking to provide personalized messaging. It stores user attributes such as name,
email address etc., along with event history.

2. API Access:
- Facebook Ads: Facebook provides a Marketing API that allows developers to create and manage ad campaigns programmatically.
- Google Ads: Google provides the AdWords API which allows developers to manage their Google AdWords accounts through custom applications.
- RDS (Relational Database Service): AWS provides an API for managing RDS instances including creating databases,
managing backups etc.
CleverTap does have an extensive RESTful API which allows access to all of the platform's functionality including user profiles.

3. Data Types:
Facebook Ads and Google Aads APIs deal with advertising campaign metadata such as budget amounts,
targeting parameters etc., along with performance
metrics like impressions,cost per click etc.

RDS deals with structured relational tabular data types such as integers,characters,floats,date/time values etc.CleverTaps focus is more on customer/user profile
attributes(user demographic attributes)and event logs or behavioral/event based data.


# 2. Design a high-level ETL pipeline architecture for extracting data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads, transforming it, and loading it into an RDS database. Consider data extraction frequency, data transformations, error handling, and scalability.

1. Data Extraction
Data Sources:
Facebook Ads
Google Ads
Frequency:
Daily extraction to ensure up-to-date data while balancing load and resource usage.
Tools:
APIs: Use Facebook Graph API and Google Ads API for data extraction.
Scheduler: Use a scheduler like Apache Airflow or AWS Lambda to run extraction jobs daily.
2. Data Transformation
Transformation Steps:
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize formats (e.g., date formats, currency).
Data Mapping: Standardize the schema for both ad platforms to a common schema.
Aggregations: Calculate metrics like total spend, click-through rates, and impressions.
Enrichment: Add additional information such as campaign metadata or business-specific KPIs.
Tools:
Transformation Engine: Use a tool like Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.
Scripts: Use Python or SQL for data manipulation and transformation.
3. Data Loading
Destination:
Amazon RDS: A managed relational database service for scalability and reliability.
Tools:
Database Loader: Use tools like SQLAlchemy or AWS Data Pipeline for loading data into RDS.
4. Error Handling
Strategies:
Logging: Implement detailed logging at each stage of the pipeline (extraction, transformation, loading) using tools like AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack.
Retries: Set up automatic retries for transient errors, particularly during data extraction.
Alerts: Configure alerts for critical failures using services like Amazon SNS or PagerDuty.
5. Scalability
Approaches:
Distributed Processing: Use distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark for handling large volumes of data.
Auto-scaling: Utilize auto-scaling features of AWS services to adjust resources based on load.
Modular Architecture: Design the pipeline to be modular, allowing components to be independently scaled or updated.
